				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Manchester United will attempt to win the UEFA Europa League for the first time when they meet Ajax in the final in Stockholm on Wednesday.With a victory, United would become the fifth club to win the three major UEFA club trophies (Champions League, Europa League and the defunct Cup Winners&#8217; Cup), joining Ajax, Bayern Munich, Chelsea and Juventus.They would also qualify to return to the Champions League after a one-year absence.</p>
<p>If United were to lose in the final, they would fail to qualify for the Champions League in consecutive seasons for the first time since 1993 &#8212; the first two years of the competition&#8217;s current format.Ajax have already qualified for the Champions League&#8217;s third qualifying round by finishing second in the Eredivisie. The thinking goes that the Celtics should move Isaiah for value now and build around Fultz, Jaylen Brown, and the Nets’ 2018 first-round pick (likely to be a good one.while staying competitive with Al Horford, a potential max-salary.pickup in 2017, Jae Crowder, and some combination of the other role players and defenders currently on the roster.</p>
<blockquote><p>The way a team plays as a whole determines its success. You may have the greatest bunch of individual stars in the world but. The thinking goes that the Celtics should move Isaiah for value now and build around.</p></blockquote>
<p>Jose Mourinho has also never lost to Ajax in six previous meetings, each of which occurred in the Champions League when he was the coach at Real Madrid from 2010 to 2013.If United were to win, Mourinho, in his first season at United, would become the first manager to win the Champions League twicea and the Europa League twice.</p>
<p>Mourinho won the UEFA Cup in 2002-03 and the Champions League in 2003-04 while with Porto, and he later won the Champions League with Inter Milan in 2009-10.United, who defeated Celta Vigo in the semifinals, enter on a run of 10 games unbeaten and have conceded only four goals in that span. Ajax, meanwhile, defeated Lyon in the semifinals and have lost two of their last three games.</p>

<p>If United were to lose in the final, they would fail to qualify for the Champions League in consecutive seasons for the first time since 1993 &#8212; the first two years of the competition&#8217;s current format.Ajax have already qualified for the Champions League&#8217;s third qualifying round by finishing second in the Eredivisie. The thinking goes that the Celtics should move Isaiah for value now and build around Fultz, Jaylen Brown, and the Nets’ 2018 first-round pick (likely to be a good one.while staying competitive with Al Horford, a potential max-salary.pickup in 2017, Jae Crowder, and some combination of the other role players and defenders currently on the roster.</p>
<blockquote><p>The way a team plays as a whole determines its success. You may have the greatest bunch of individual stars in the world but. The thinking goes that the Celtics should move Isaiah for value now and build around.</p></blockquote>
<p>Jose Mourinho has also never lost to Ajax in six previous meetings, each of which occurred in the Champions League when he was the coach at Real Madrid from 2010 to 2013.If United were to win, Mourinho, in his first season at United, would become the first manager to win the Champions League twicea and the Europa League twice.</p>
<p>Mourinho won the UEFA Cup in 2002-03 and the Champions League in 2003-04 while with Porto, and he later won the Champions League with Inter Milan in 2009-10.United, who defeated Celta Vigo in the semifinals, enter on a run of 10 games unbeaten and have conceded only four goals in that span. Ajax, meanwhile, defeated Lyon in the semifinals and have lost two of their last three games.</p>
